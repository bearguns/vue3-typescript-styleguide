To begin, make sure you have a personal access token configured on

authenticating, but the steps below can assist:

** Installing private packages from GitHub
1. Make sure you have a personal access token created in GitHub
   - Authenticate to GitHub.com
   - Navigate to Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens
   - Generate a personal access token with repo scopes, and
     ~write:packages~, ~read:packages~ scopes.
2. Create a file in your user directory called ~.npmrc~:
=$ touch ~/.npmrc=
3. In your text editor, add the following to ~~/.npmrc~, substituting
   your personal access token:
#+BEGIN_SRC
@teliax:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
#+END_SRC
